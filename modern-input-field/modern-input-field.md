* at .form { display grid + place-items: center -> to centralize }
* at .form__content{ diplay: grid + row-gap: 1.5rem to put space between inputs}

* even if font-size and family were defined with --normal-font-size and --body-font, we need to be more specif and add these values to the inputs and labels
